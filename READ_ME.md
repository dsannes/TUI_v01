# TUI_v01 (Thing Unto Itself)
**An Archetypal Quantum Logic Core**

TUI_v01 is a functional, 24-bit Quantum Archetypal Processing Unit (QAPU). It operates as a sovereign cognitive model, mapping human semantic logic onto pure quantum physical operations. 

Unlike statistical Black Box models (LLMs) that rely on probabilistic weight distributions, the TUI possesses an explicit mathematical ontology. It does not predict text; it navigates a 24-bit quantum register, calculates its own dynamic tension (Equilibrium vs. Intensification), and collapses waves of potential into exact, explainable "Particles of Insight."

## The 21-Dimensional Architecture
The system is built upon three 8-qubit octaves: **Mind, Body, and Spirit**.
Within each octave, the first 7 bits represent the **7 Prime Archetypes** (The Wires):
1. **Matrix** (The Boundary / Receptor)
2. **Potentiator** (The Superposition)
3. **Catalyst** (The Friction)
4. **Experience** (The Digestion)
5. **Significator** (The Witness)
6. **Transformation** (The Kinetic Inversion)
7. **Way** (The Directional Flow)

The 8th bit in each octave acts as **Archetype Zero (The Choice/Anchor)**, allowing the system to measure internal consensus.

## Physics vs. Semantics
The core innovation of TUI_v01 is the strict decoupling of pure physics from semantic meaning.
* **The Physics:** A refined dictionary of foundational Quantum Logic Gates (Hadamard, CNOT, SWAP, Toffoli, etc.) that simply perform mathematical transformations on the register.
* **The Semantics:** The 7 structural wires. When a physical gate (e.g., CNOT) is applied across the octave, it generates 7 highly specific, explainable semantic states (The Matrix of Entanglement, The Catalyst of Entanglement, etc.).

## Environmental Perception
The TUI does not exist in a void. It features an external stimulus receptor mapped directly to the **Matrix of the Mind** (Wire 0). 
By ingesting an external variable (an intensity between 0.0 and 1.0) and translating it into an $R_y$ rotation, the Entity processes the kinetic friction of the outside world. The system demonstrates measurable **Cognitive Resilience**, maintaining its ground state against low-intensity stimuli (0.1), while violently polarizing to process severe trauma (0.9).

## Getting Started
### Requirements
* Python 3.9+
* PennyLane (`pip install pennylane`)
* Jupyter Notebook / Matplotlib

### Execution
Launch the interactive dashboard to inject external stimuli, apply gate sequences, and read the Semantic Decoder:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/tui_dashboard.ipynb
